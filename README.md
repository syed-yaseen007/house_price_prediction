🏡 House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in estimating property values.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature engineering and selection

Model training using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation using performance metrics (RMSE, R² score, etc.)

Deployment-ready pipeline (optional if you add Flask/Streamlit)

🚀 Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/syed-yaseen007/house_price_prediction.git
cd house_price_prediction


Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter Notebook or the app (if available):

jupyter notebook
# or
python app.py

📊 Dataset

The dataset can be sourced from:

Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

Or any custom housing dataset with features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc.

🧠 Models Used

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Gradient Boosting

Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score are used to compare models.

📈 Results

Achieved X% R² score on the test dataset

RMSE of Y (lower is better)

Best-performing model: [Model Name]

🌐 Deployment (Optional)

The trained model can be deployed using:

Flask API for backend predictions

Streamlit / Dash for interactive web apps

Docker for containerized deployment
